Journey mapping.

 What are the steps required to download and install I2P? 
		
Where are the pain points, and what could a guide/wizard do to help mitigate some of those pain points?  
		
Who is this journey for? What assumptions have we made about this process and who will use I2P? It assumes 
dev knowledge, privacy knowledge, technical ability

Is it important to have more than just java, IOS, Windows and Linux here?
		
Move extra installer/ launchers / specific java packaging to OS page too make the download page less overwhelming
		
Create sections for each OS & browser and clean up references to OSes and browsers in the shared text. 
            
Add descriptions where appropriate so that it is more clear what the recommended set up is
		
		
Remove technical jargon
		
where to put docker and manual updates?
		
Set up wizard for first time installs ? what would be the order? Java, i2p, extensions? Requires screenshots, new docs, 
		
do we need reference to keys? Are some of these dev - centric / security centric items scary? Can this be presented better?

**Being directed to external website increases distrust.
**Having to install a different package (Java) disrupts the flow
