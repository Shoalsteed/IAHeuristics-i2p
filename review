• What is I2P?
	• The goal of this project
	• Design problems we addressed
		• Documentation UX and website IA — many user groups, long history, TMI
		• Terminology — benefits and issues with using Tor-like terminology
		• I2P the network, community, tool? — how things fits together + creating new mental models
	• Activities
		• 1 heuristics review
		• 2 IA workshops
	• Results
		• UI/UX recommendations (summarize heuristics review rec's)
		• New IA proposal / principles going forward
		• Browser extension direction
		• Process recommendations: journey mapping, user testing
	• Lessons
		• Looking at IA and words surfaces underlying questions around strategy
		• "How does it work" isn't just about the tech, but about how to use it
		• When technology is new, rely on familiar patterns as much as possible
